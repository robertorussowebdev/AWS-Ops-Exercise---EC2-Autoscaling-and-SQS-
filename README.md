# AWS Ops Exercise - EC2 Autoscaling and SQS
(Roberto Russo solution) 

**Explanation of the exercise**


This exercise involves setting up an **AWS environment** where **EC2 instances scale based on SQS queue messages**.

-It includes creating an **SQS queue**

-Writing **Python scripts for a message producer (running on your desktop), and a consumer (running on EC2 instances)**.

-Additionally, it involves setting up **an EC2 Auto Scaling group** with the **consumer script** in its **launch template bootstrap process**  and testing the **scale-out/in mechanism based on the queue's message load.**

# Prerequisites:
- A clean AWS CLI environment where you have already set your Access Keys.

- IAM Role with the necessary SQS access policies for sending and receiving messages for EC2 instances.

- A standard Amazon SQS Queue.

- A Key Pair for EC2 instances.

- A Public Amazon S3 Bucket. Ensure that the bucket has the appropriate GetObject policy applied.

- Python scripts for Producer and Consumer: Producer.py should be on your desktop, and Consumer.py should be in a bucket to make it downloadable on your EC2 instances.

- An Autoscaling Group with Scaling Policies attached to Amazon CloudWatch Alarms.

- A Launch Template.

- Two CloudWatch Alarms for Scale Out and Scale In processes.

# Step 1: Check for your AWS CLI
Make sure you have a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** installed on your **desktop**; 

it is a mandatory requirement to launch the **producer script from the desktop** and gain access to the AWS environment.

- To verify this, open your **Command Prompt** and enter:

  ```
  aws --version
  aws configure get aws_access_key_id
  aws configure get aws_secret_access_key
  ```

If the prompt returns your access key credentials, it means you have already set them, and therefore, you have access to AWS resources.

Let's continue with the exercise.

# Step 2: Create a Standard SQS Queue

Now, let's create your Amazon SQS Queue.

- Open your AWS Console Home and use the search bar to find '**SQS**.' Click on the 'Simple Queue Service' result.
- In the SQS dashboard, navigate to **Create queue**.
- Enter the **Name** as 'MyQueue,' leave the other settings as defaults, and then click on **Create queue**. p.s. I setted MyQueue,but you can use every name you want for all the exercise.

Set your SQS Queue Name and then leave all settings as defaults.

Final result â†’ You created your SQS Queue


# Step 3: Create a IAM Role for EC2 instances

1. Navigate to **IAM > Roles** and click on **Create role**.
2. Select **EC2** under use case and click **Next**.
3. Leave all options at their defaults and click **Next**.
4. Provide a Name for your Role and then click **Create Role**.
5. Once the Role is created, go to **Role > Permissions > Add Permissions > Create Inline Policy**.
6. In the Create Inline Policy, choose JSON, and replace the existing JSON policy with the following.
7. Click **Next** and then **Save Changes**.
8. Add a **Policy Name**.
9. You have successfully created your IAM Role and attached the SQS policy!
